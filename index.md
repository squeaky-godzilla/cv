## ðŸ”¥ Some notable projects

**SRE Assessment**, (handled remotely) â€” Helping the customer identify their strengths and weaknesses in building reliability-focused culture & technology. (2021)
  
Iâ€™ve led the consulting project targeted at improving my customerâ€™s perception of service reliability, driving the adoption of SRE ways of working. We've done interviews and sessions with the customer's teams to find areas of improvement 

**Cloud Native iOS Build Automation**, Helsinki, FI â€” Fully automated "source to AppStore" build pipeline using exclusively cloud resources. (2020)
  
Fully automated workflows for Apple platforms - let alone entirely cloud-based - are quite rare, so I am proud to say Iâ€™ve built one.


**Service Level Monitoring Framework for Engineering**, Helsinki, FI â€” Tracking SLI/SLA/SLO for service owners to build meaningful Service Level Agreements, based on engineering metrics. (2019)

This platform enabled the company to put a service health state in as a metric. Iâ€™ve used just Prometheus + Grafana stack to build the framework and taught the developers to use it through a series of workshops. Itâ€™s something any dev can easily take ownership of. Clear, no-nonsense framework for a company to adopt SLAs that are meaningful for the customer and transparent for engineers.

**Rogue change tracking for Google Kubernetes Engine**, Helsinki, FI â€” Tracking manual changes in GKE with Stackdriver and Grafana (2019)

In the effort to achieve immutable production infrastructure for Unity Technologies, I've built a tracking system based on Stackdriver log exports and Grafana annotations to help the service owner teams understand the impact of manual changes on services reliability.


**Incident management for DevOps**, Helsinki, FI â€” How to run incidents with the traditional incident management benefits (2019)

To improve the incident resolution time and reduce the stress on developers, I've redesigned the process for incident management and postmortems.

**Splunk Cloud hidden performance metrics collector**, London, UK â€” Monitoring Splunk Cloud AWS deployment VM metrics (2018)

Having problems with the performance of Splunk-as-a-Service offering, I have build a metrics collector in Golang, that was targeting undocumented Splunk API endpoints to retrieve the AWS related VM metrics into the Hadoop based TSDB and made the data available via Grafana dashboards.
